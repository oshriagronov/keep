## General info
The project is a Google keep "copy" where you can create notes!(currently I didn't set any limit maybe in future).
On every note you have the option to write title and content of the note(both optional).

## Technologies
- Software language: JS, HTML, CSS.
- React.

## Features
- Create as many notes as you want!
- The user can delete notes, just hover with the mouse to the note you want to delete and the "minus" button will pop up.

## Setup
To run "Keep" you need couple of softwares:
- Js, Html, Css
- npm modules I included(easy to install).
- React.

### How to start?
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Future update

- Labels with colors
